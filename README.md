# SigJar

![SigJar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giannivh/SigJar/master/images/signature48.png "SigJar logo") A Google Chrome extension that allows you to create fancy HTML signatures which can be used when composing mails.

## Why SigJar?

If you use a webmail app as your default emailing app, you'll notice the lack of support for decent HTML signatures. And if they allow you to configure a signature, it's usually one - with very basic HTML support. Google Inbox, for one, allows you to configure a HTML signature by copy-pasting a HTML page/selection into the editor box, but without a HTML code editor, you'll lose a lot of markup. It makes it useless if you want to have a fancier signature.

That's why SigJar was created. It's a simple Google Chrome extension which can insert HTML code into a content editor, like a mail composer window. You can create one or more signatures through the SigJar options.

## How to create a signature?

Go to the Google Chrome extensions page, and select "Options" of the SigJar extension. Alternatively, right click anywhere in a page, hover over "SigJar" and select "Options" from the submenu.

Follow the on-screen instructions to create your fancy HTML signature. There are a few templates to get you started.
